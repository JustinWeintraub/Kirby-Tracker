A React Native/Firebase project. Companion tool for playing Kirby video games, keeping track of your progress and giving tips to get all the collectables in the games listed. 
Utilizes typescript. Utilizes web scraping to get the data for each game, including information about every treasure in said game. 
Uses recursion to keep track of completed levels for each user.
